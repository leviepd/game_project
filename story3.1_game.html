	Restart Buttom instead of refreshing
	If act is not property... be able to alert other than "can't go that way"
	"Show actions" (prompt) --- verbs to do things "go", "look", "take", "fight", "search", "use"
	--- objects don't need to be shown... they are in the description... --- player use action "take" for objects, or "use".
